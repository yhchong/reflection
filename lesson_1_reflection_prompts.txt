How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	Seeing the difference will tell you the changes that have been made between the 2 versions. Such changes
	are usually the source of error if the older version can work but the latest cannot.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	Getting used to doing version will help shorten debugging time needed for large project.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	It allows you to control how big or small changes are between each commit. This is important to ensure the effectiveness of version control.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Some times the files have dependency with each other such that changing a file requires changing another.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	No idea.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

	It allows you to always revert to a previous working version and remake the correct changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Everything fun.
